	The garden was inspired by the 300-year-old K≈çraku-en Garden in Okayama, so it is also called the Pune-Okayama Friendship Garden. The garden has naturally flowing water from a canal, and this flow has been spread across the garden. The garden is well maintained, and walking on the lawn is not allowed.
